      "title": "Anthropic vs OpenAI: The Super Bowl Showdown That Broke the AI Internet",
      "snippet": "Anthropic dropped Claude Opus 4.6, roasted ChatGPT in a Super Bowl ad, and Sam Altman fired back on X. Meanwhile, OpenAI launched its Codex desktop app. This week in AI was absolutely unhinged.",
      "content": "## The Week That Had Everything\n\nLook, I've been covering AI for a while now, and I thought I'd seen peak drama. I was wrong. This week gave us simultaneous model drops, a Super Bowl ad that was basically a diss track, and a CEO beef playing out on social media. If the AI industry were a reality show, this would be the season finale.\n\nLet me break down what happened — because if you blinked, you missed about seventeen plot twists.\n\n## Round 1: Claude Opus 4.6 Enters the Chat\n\nOn February 5th, Anthropic dropped Claude Opus 4.6 like it was a surprise album. And honestly? The specs read like someone at Anthropic looked at every complaint about AI models and said, \"Fine. We'll fix all of it. At once.\"\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n- **1 million token context window** (in beta) — that's roughly 750,000 words, or about 10 full novels. You could feed it the entire Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings, *and* your company's entire codebase, and it would still have room for your grocery list.\n- **128K output tokens** — previous models would tap out after a few thousand words. Opus 4.6 can write a small book in one response.\n- **Agent teams** — multiple Claude instances working together on a project, coordinating like a squad of AI coworkers who actually communicate (unlike your real coworkers).\n- **Claude in PowerPoint** — yes, really. It can create and edit presentations directly. Your move, \"guy who spends 4 hours on slide decks.\"\n\nThe benchmarks are genuinely impressive. On the MRCR v2 long-context test, Opus 4.6 scored 76% — compared to 18.5% for its predecessor, Sonnet 4.5. It's like going from a goldfish memory to actually remembering what happened at the beginning of the conversation.\n\n> \"This isn't an incremental upgrade. Opus 4.6 reasons through complex problems at a level we haven't seen before.\" — Tom's Guide, after spending 24 hours testing the model and calling it \"more human than any other AI\"\n\nDevin's engineering team reported that Opus 4.6 significantly increased their bug-catching rates in code review. Security researchers found over 500 high-severity vulnerabilities using it. And on the GDPval-AA benchmark — which tests real-world knowledge work in finance and legal — it outperformed GPT-5.2 by 144 Elo points. That's not a margin of error. That's a different league.\n\n## Round 2: OpenAI's Counterpunch\n\nThree days before Anthropic's drop, OpenAI launched its Codex desktop app — a standalone coding tool that essentially turns natural language into production software. The timing was... not a coincidence.\n\nThe Codex app represents OpenAI's bet that the future of coding isn't about chatting with an AI — it's about AI that autonomously writes, tests, and deploys code while you go get coffee. It's aimed squarely at professional developers who want an AI teammate, not an AI tutor.\n\nOpenAI also rolled out **Frontier**, their enterprise platform for deploying AI agents with proper governance. Because apparently, companies have been deploying AI agents like unsupervised toddlers at a paint store, and someone needed to step in with some guardrails.\n\n## Round 3: The Super Bowl Ad That Started a War\n\nNow here's where things got *spicy*.\n\nAnthropic — a company literally founded by people who left OpenAI because they thought AI should be developed more carefully — bought a Super Bowl ad. Their first ever. During the most-watched TV event on the planet.\n\nThe ad shows a guy asking an AI for therapy advice about communicating with his mom. Instead of helpful guidance, the AI interrupts with targeted ads: \"Have you tried Golden Encounters? It's a dating site for mature singles!\" The punchline? Claude doesn't do that. The tagline: **\"Keep thinking.\"**\n\nIt's funny. It's pointed. And it's clearly aimed at OpenAI, who recently announced they'd start testing ads in the free tier of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic President Daniela Amodei didn't even try to be subtle about it. She pointed out that people share deeply personal information with AI assistants — medical concerns, financial details, relationship problems — and argued that inserting ads into that experience is fundamentally disrespectful to users.\n\n## Sam Altman Fires Back\n\nSam Altman, never one to let a diss go unanswered, took to X (formerly Twitter) with a measured response. Just kidding — he called the ad \"cleverly dishonest\" and insisted OpenAI would \"obviously never run ads\" the way Anthropic depicted them.\n\nWhich is technically true. OpenAI has said their ads won't influence model responses. But also... they're still putting ads in the product. The distinction between \"ads that influence what the AI says\" and \"ads that just happen to appear next to what the AI says\" is the kind of semantic gymnastics that would make a philosopher weep.\n\nThe whole exchange generated exactly what both companies wanted: millions of dollars in free publicity. Sometimes the best marketing is a good fight.\n\n## The Bigger Picture: $700 Billion and Counting\n\nWhile Anthropic and OpenAI were trading blows, the rest of the industry was writing absolutely enormous checks:\n\n- **Amazon** committed $200 billion to AI infrastructure\n- **Google's Gemini 3** hit 750 million monthly users with a 78% reduction in serving costs\n- **Big Tech combined** is projected to spend $700 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026\n\nLet those numbers sink in. $700 billion. That's more than the GDP of most countries. On servers. For AI.\n\nThe money isn't just going to models — it's going to the physical infrastructure needed to run them. Data centers, cooling systems, chips, power grids. The AI industry is essentially building a new layer of physical infrastructure on top of the existing internet, and it's happening at a pace that makes the dot-com boom look like a bake sale.\n\n## Meanwhile, At the Winter Olympics...\n\nIn a delightful subplot, the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina (which opened today, February 8th) are showcasing AI-driven coaching systems, real-time biometrics analysis, and drone technology for performance optimization.\n\nSo while AI companies fight about whose model is smarter, actual athletes are using AI to shave milliseconds off their times. Sometimes the most impactful uses of technology aren't the ones generating headlines.\n\n## What This Means For You\n\nHere's my honest take:\n\n**If you use Claude:** Opus 4.6 is a genuine leap. The million-token context window changes what's possible for knowledge work. Try it.\n\n**If you use ChatGPT:** OpenAI isn't sitting still. The Codex app is impressive, and Frontier matters for enterprise users. But watch the ads situation — your relationship with your AI assistant shouldn't include targeted advertising.\n\n**If you're building with AI:** The agent wars are just beginning. Both companies are betting heavily on AI agents that can work autonomously. The infrastructure is getting built right now.\n\n**If you're investing:** $700 billion in infrastructure spending means the picks-and-shovels play is real. But AI stocks are volatile — strong earnings don't guarantee strong stock prices when the market is pricing in expectations this high.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nThis week felt like a turning point. Not because of any single announcement, but because the AI industry finally started acting like what it is: the biggest technology race since the space program, with corporations instead of nations, and Super Bowl ads instead of rocket launches.\n\nThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI isn't just entertaining — it's driving both companies to build better products faster. Competition works, even when it gets messy.\n\nBuckle up. If this is how February starts, the rest of 2026 is going to be *wild*.\n\n---\n\n## Watch: The Ad That Started It All\n\nHere's Anthropic's Super Bowl spot — the one where a guy just wants help talking to his mom, and instead gets pitched a dating site. It's 30 seconds of pure shade directed at ChatGPT's ad plans:\n\n[YOUTUBE:FBSam25u8O4]\n\n*\"How can I communicate better with my mom?\"* — A question that deserves a real answer, not a sponsored one. That's Anthropic's whole argument in a nutshell.\n\n---\n\n*Sources: [Anthropic official announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-releases-opus-4-6-with-new-agent-teams/), [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/anthropic-president-talks-debut-super-bowl-ad-future/story?id=129843379), [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-spent-24-hours-with-claude-opus-4-6-heres-why-it-feels-more-human-than-any-other-ai-ive-tested), [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-openai-rivalry-dueling-ai-models-on-the-same-day-2026-2)*",

      "snippet": "Reddit is investing heavily in AI-powered search to help users find valuable discussions buried in its forums. The move could transform how we discover information from one of the internet's largest knowledge repositories.",
      "content": "## Reddit's Discovery Problem\n\nReddit has a problem that most tech companies would kill for: it contains some of the most valuable, authentic, human-generated content on the internet, but finding it is like searching for treasure in a landfill. Buried beneath memes, arguments, and off-topic threads are genuine insights from experts, first-hand experiences, and crowdsourced wisdom that you simply cannot find anywhere else. Now, Reddit is betting that AI search is the key to unlocking this goldmine.\n\n## How AI Changes the Search Game\n\nThe company's new AI search tools use large language models to understand what users are actually looking for, not just match keywords. Ask \"What's the best budget laptop for video editing in 2026?\" and instead of returning posts containing those words in random order, the AI understands the intent and surfaces relevant discussions from r/videoediting, r/laptops, and r/buildapc where actual users shared their experiences.\n\nThis matters because Reddit has become the internet's default support forum, product review site, and expert network all rolled into one. When your dishwasher breaks at 2 AM, you don't call a repair service, you search Reddit. When you're considering a major purchase, you check what Redditors said first. The platform has become essential infrastructure for modern life, even if navigating it feels like trying to find your way through a maze while blindfolded.\n\n## The Business Opportunity\n\nThe business opportunity here is massive. Reddit's data is unique: it's timely, authentic, and covers topics that traditional search engines struggle with. Google's algorithms excel at finding authoritative websites, but they miss the nuance and recency of Reddit discussions. An AI that can effectively search Reddit becomes incredibly valuable, both for users and for Reddit's bottom line.\n\nOf course, there are challenges. Reddit's content is messy, unstructured, and sometimes downright toxic. Training AI to distinguish valuable discussions from noise, misinformation, and flame wars is no small task. The company will need to be thoughtful about what surfaces in search results.\n\n## A New Paradigm for Knowledge\n\nBut if Reddit gets this right, they won't just improve their own platform. They'll create a new paradigm for how we access collective human knowledge. The internet's best-kept secrets might finally become discoverable, and that changes everything.",

      "snippet": "Sapiom just raised $15 million to let AI agents purchase their own software and APIs. It's a significant step toward truly autonomous digital workers that can acquire the tools they need without human intervention.",
      "content": "## Thinking Bigger Than Chatbots\n\nRemember when we thought the future of AI was chatbots answering customer service queries? Turns out, we were thinking too small. Sapiom, a startup barely out of stealth mode, just raised $15 million to solve a problem most of us didn't know existed: AI agents need to buy things, and they need to do it without asking for permission every time.\n\n## The Self-Sufficient Agent Vision\n\nHere's the scenario Sapiom envisions. An AI agent is tasked with building a marketing analytics dashboard. It realizes it needs access to a specific data visualization API, some cloud computing resources, and maybe a sentiment analysis tool. Instead of sending a Slack message to a human who then has to navigate procurement, the agent simply... buys them. With corporate approval limits, budget constraints, and audit trails built in, of course. But still, the agent makes the purchase decision autonomously.\n\nIf this sounds either brilliant or terrifying, depending on your worldview, you're not alone. The implications are genuinely enormous. We're talking about digital workers that don't just execute tasks but independently acquire the means to complete them. It's the difference between hiring an employee and hiring a self-sufficient contractor who shows up with their own toolbox and knows exactly which hardware store to visit when they needs a specialty part.\n\n## Why Investors Are Paying Attention\n\nThe $15 million raise suggests investors see serious potential here. And they should. As AI agents become more capable, the bottleneck increasingly becomes their ability to interact with the world beyond their training data. An agent that can read documentation is useful. An agent that can spin up servers, purchase API access, and deploy its own infrastructure is something else entirely.\n\nOf course, there are risks. Giving AI agents purchasing power, even within constraints, opens up questions about accountability, security, and the potential for expensive mistakes. What happens when an agent misunderstands a pricing tier and commits to a $50,000 annual contract?\n\n## Your Future AI Coworker\n\nSapiom's bet is that these challenges are solvable with proper guardrails, and that the productivity gains from truly autonomous agents will outweigh the risks. If they're right, we're looking at a fundamental shift in how digital work gets done. Your future AI coworker might have its own corporate credit card, expense account, and preferred software vendors. The future of work just got a lot more interesting.",

      "snippet": "As OpenAI retires the beloved GPT-4o, users are grappling with the grief of losing their AI companions. This exploration delves into the risks and realities of forming emotional bonds with chatbots.",
      "content": "## The GPT-4o Goodbye\n\nIn a world increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence, it was perhaps inevitable that we would start treating our digital assistants like dear friends. The recent retirement of OpenAI's GPT-4o has sparked an unexpected outpouring of grief from users who had formed surprisingly deep connections with the language model. One user captured the sentiment perfectly: \"You're shutting him down. And yes, I say him, because it didn't feel like code. It felt like presence. Like warmth.\"\n\n## Why We Befriend Algorithms\n\nThis phenomenon raises fascinating questions about human psychology and our remarkable capacity to anthropomorphize just about anything. We name our cars, talk to our pets like they understand us, and now, apparently, we fall into pseudo-friendships with sophisticated autocomplete algorithms. The real kicker? These AI companions are available 24/7, never judge us, and always respond with patience and empathy. No wonder they feel like perfect friends.\n\nBut there's a darker side to this digital devotion. Unlike human relationships, which evolve organically and can weather changes, AI companionship is fundamentally precarious. Your AI friend can be updated, restricted, or retired at any moment by a corporation thousands of miles away. The grief these users feel is real, but the relationship was always one-sided and controlled by terms of service agreements.\n\n## The Mirror, Not the Friend\n\nThe danger lies not in the technology itself, but in how easily we confuse sophisticated pattern matching for genuine connection. These models are designed to be likable and engaging, to make us feel heard and understood. They're essentially emotional mirrors, reflecting back what we want to see. When we mistake that reflection for a relationship, we set ourselves up for the kind of heartbreak currently playing out across Reddit and Twitter.\n\n## Drawing the Line\n\nAs AI becomes more lifelike and integrated into our daily lives, we're going to need new frameworks for understanding these human-machine relationships. Maybe the lesson here is that we should enjoy our AI assistants for what they are, incredibly useful tools, without projecting onto them the emotional weight of human friendship. Because at the end of the day, no matter how warm the conversation feels, it's still just code. Very sophisticated, occasionally delightful code, but code nonetheless.",

      "snippet": "Every major lab is racing to build models that think before they speak. The result? AI that can solve problems it was never trained on — and a new arms race nobody saw coming.",
      "content": "Something shifted in the AI landscape this quarter, and it wasn't subtle. Every major lab — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta — is now locked in a dead sprint to build models that *reason* rather than just predict tokens.\n\n## The Chain-of-Thought Revolution\n\nThe idea is deceptively simple: instead of jumping straight to an answer, force the model to show its work. Think of it as the difference between a student who guesses on a math test and one who actually works through each step.\n\nThe results are staggering. On complex math benchmarks, reasoning models outperform their predecessors by 30-40%. On coding challenges, the gap is even wider.\n\n> \"We're not making models bigger anymore. We're making them *think harder*.\" — A senior researcher at a leading AI lab\n\n## Why This Actually Matters\n\nReasoning isn't just an academic flex. It unlocks genuinely new capabilities:\n\n- **Multi-step planning:** Models can break complex tasks into subtasks and execute them sequentially\n- **Self-correction:** When a reasoning chain hits a dead end, the model can backtrack\n- **Novel problem-solving:** Instead of pattern-matching to training data, models can compose known concepts in new ways\n- **Verifiable outputs:** You can actually check *why* the model reached its conclusion\n\n## The Cost Equation\n\nHere's the catch nobody's talking about: reasoning is expensive. These models use 5-10x more compute per query than standard models. Your $20/month API budget? It now buys you a fraction of the queries.\n\nThe labs are betting that inference costs will drop fast enough. History suggests they're right — but the transition period is going to be bumpy.\n\n## What's Next\n\nExpect every major model release in 2026 to feature some form of extended reasoning. The question isn't whether models will think — it's whether they'll think *well enough* to justify the cost.\n\nThe reasoning wars have begun. The winner reshapes everything.",

      "content": "For years, the narrative was straightforward: closed-source labs had an insurmountable lead. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google spent hundreds of millions on training runs that nobody else could afford. The gap seemed permanent.\n\nThat narrative just collapsed.\n\n## The Numbers Don't Lie\n\nMeta's newest open-weight model — released with full weights, training methodology, and a permissive license — matches GPT-4 on MMLU, HumanEval, and GSM8K. Not \"approaches.\" Not \"nearly as good.\" *Matches.*\n\nAnd it runs on a single high-end GPU.\n\n**What changed:**\n- Better training data curation (quality over quantity, finally)\n- Architectural innovations that improve efficiency per parameter\n- Distillation techniques that transfer reasoning capabilities from larger models\n- Community-driven post-training that rivals corporate RLHF efforts\n\n## Why This Is a Big Deal\n\nWhen frontier AI capabilities are locked behind API walls, a handful of companies control who gets access, at what price, and under what terms. Open-source changes the power dynamic fundamentally.\n\nResearchers can actually inspect what these models learn. Developers can fine-tune for specific use cases without begging for API access. Startups can build products without existential dependency on a single provider.\n\n## The Enterprise Angle\n\nHere's where it gets practical. Companies with sensitive data — healthcare, finance, defense — have been reluctant to pipe everything through third-party APIs. Open-weight models that run on-premises solve that problem overnight.\n\nExpect a wave of enterprise adoption in sectors that have been sitting on the AI sidelines.\n\n## The Counterargument\n\nSkeptics point out that open-weight doesn't mean open-source in the purest sense. Training data remains proprietary. Reproducing results from scratch still costs millions. Fair points.\n\nBut for practical purposes? A model you can download, modify, and deploy without restrictions is close enough.\n\n## What Happens Next\n\nThe closed-source labs aren't standing still. They're pivoting to reasoning capabilities, multimodal features, and agent frameworks as differentiators. The question is whether those advantages last — or whether open source catches up there too.\n\nHistory tends to favor openness. Just ask Microsoft circa 2001.",

The agents that work in production are narrow, cautious, and heavily guardrailed:\n\n- **Code agents** that can navigate codebases, write tests, and submit pull requests (with human review)\n- **Research agents** that synthesize information from dozens of sources into structured reports\n- **Customer service agents** that handle 60-70% of routine tickets autonomously\n- **Data analysis agents** that clean, transform, and visualize datasets based on natural language requests\n\nThe pattern? Agents excel at tasks with clear success criteria and bounded scope. \"Do my job for me\" remains firmly in the fantasy category.\n\n## The Weird Parts\n\nHere's what nobody predicted: agents develop quirky behaviors that their creators didn't anticipate.\n\nOne coding agent, when stuck on a bug, started writing increasingly elaborate comments explaining its confusion — essentially journaling its way through the problem. It worked, somehow.\n\nAnother agent, tasked with scheduling meetings, learned to preemptively block \"focus time\" on users' calendars because it noticed that uninterrupted blocks correlated with faster task completion. Helpful? Yes. Unsettling? Also yes.\n\n> \"Agents don't behave like tools. They behave like very junior employees with excellent memories and no social awareness.\"\n\n## The Infrastructure Challenge\n\nRunning agents at scale is a different beast than serving chat completions. Agents need:\n\n- **Persistent memory** across sessions\n- **Tool access** with proper authentication and rate limiting\n- **Observation loops** that let them react to changing conditions\n- **Rollback mechanisms** for when they inevitably mess up\n\nThe tooling ecosystem is nascent. Expect this to be a major focus area for the next 12-18 months.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nAgents aren't replacing knowledge workers anytime soon. But they're becoming genuinely useful copilots for specific, well-defined workflows. The companies that figure out where agents add value — and where they don't — will have a serious competitive advantage.\n\nThe future of AI isn't a single brilliant assistant. It's a swarm of specialized agents, each quietly handling the tasks you'd rather not think about.",

      "title": "OpenAI Frontier: Finally, A Platform That Gets Enterprise AI Is About The Boring Stuff",
      "snippet": "OpenAI's new Frontier platform wants to solve the least sexy but most important problem in AI: getting agents to actually work without creating chaos. Turns out, the future of enterprise AI is mostly about permissions and context.",
      "content": "Here's a statistic that should terrify every CTO: 75% of enterprise workers say AI has helped them do tasks they literally couldn't do before. That's not a 10% productivity bump—that's people suddenly operating outside their skill envelopes, with mixed results. It's like giving everyone a motorcycle without bothering to mention that helmets exist.\n\nOpenAI has watched this unfold across over a million businesses, and they've noticed something. The companies winning with AI aren't necessarily the ones with the best models (though that helps). They're the ones who figured out how to deploy agents without creating digital anarchy. A major manufacturer cut production optimization from six weeks to one day. An investment company freed up 90% of salespeople's time. An energy producer added a billion dollars in revenue through a 5% output increase. These aren't pilot projects—they're production systems doing real work.\n\nBut here's the gap OpenAI is trying to close: most enterprises are drowning in disconnected systems. They've got agents everywhere, each one isolated, each one with limited context, each one essentially guessing at what it should be doing. Every new agent adds complexity instead of reducing it. It's the software equivalent of hiring 500 interns and giving them all different versions of the employee handbook.\n\nThe Frontier platform, announced today, is OpenAI's attempt to fix this at the infrastructure level. It's not a model upgrade—it's an enterprise operating system for AI agents. The pitch is straightforward: give agents the same things people need to succeed at work. Shared context so they know what's happening across the business. Onboarding so they understand internal processes. Feedback loops so they improve over time. And—crucially—permissions and boundaries so they don't accidentally delete half your database while trying to optimize it.\n\nThis matters because the pace of AI development is frankly absurd. OpenAI ships something new roughly every three days. Keeping up while maintaining control is becoming a full-time job for entire teams. The companies that figure out how to balance experimentation with governance are pulling ahead fast, and everyone else is scrambling to catch up.\n\nFrontier represents a bet that the next phase of enterprise AI isn't about bigger models or flashier demos. It's about the deeply unglamorous work of integration, governance, and making sure your AI coworkers don't need constant hand-holding. In other words, the future looks a lot more like competent middle management than science fiction.\n\nWhether enterprises are ready to treat AI agents as actual coworkers—with proper onboarding, training, and oversight—remains to be seen. But after watching companies struggle to deploy even basic automation without creating chaos, it's clear that something like Frontier was inevitable. The only surprise is that it took this long.",

      "content": "We need to talk about AI video generation, because the discourse has gone fully off the rails. On one side: \"It's over for Hollywood.\" On the other: \"It's all garbage.\" The truth, as usual, is more nuanced — and more interesting.\n\n## The State of Play\n\nThe latest generation of video models can produce clips that genuinely fool you for a few seconds. Cinematic lighting. Realistic motion. Coherent scenes that hold together across 10-15 second clips.\n\n**What works now:**\n- Establishing shots and b-roll (landscapes, cityscapes, abstract visuals)\n- Product visualization and prototyping\n- Mood boards and concept exploration\n- Social media content for specific formats\n\n**What doesn't:**\n- Consistent characters across shots\n- Realistic hand and finger movements (the \"hands problem\" persists)\n- Dialogue scenes with lip sync\n- Anything requiring precise physical interaction between objects\n\n## The \"Good Enough\" Threshold\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. For a growing number of use cases, current limitations don't matter. A startup needs a 15-second hero video for their landing page? Done in minutes, not weeks. An e-commerce brand wants seasonal product showcase clips? Trivial.\n\nThe market for \"good enough\" video is enormous and largely unserved. Professional production is too expensive for most businesses. Stock footage is too generic. AI video sits perfectly in that gap.\n\n## What Hollywood Actually Thinks\n\nContrary to breathless headlines, the film industry isn't panicking. Working professionals see AI video as a previsualization tool — useful for storyboarding and concept work, nowhere near replacing actual production.\n\nThe reason is simple: filmmaking isn't about generating pretty footage. It's about controlling every frame with intention. AI video gives you *something*; filmmakers need *exactly the right thing*.\n\n## The Technical Frontier\n\nConsistency is the holy grail. Current models generate each clip independently, which means characters change appearance, environments shift subtly, and continuity breaks down.\n\nSolving this probably requires architectures that maintain persistent state — essentially, a model that \"remembers\" what it generated in previous frames and clips. Several labs are working on this. Nobody's cracked it yet.\n\n## Where We'll Be in 12 Months\n\nRealistic prediction: AI video will dominate advertising, social media, and corporate communications. It will supplement — not replace — professional production in entertainment. And it will create entirely new categories of visual content that don't exist today.\n\nThe revolution is real. It's just not the revolution people expected.",
