  "content": "<p>Here's a statistic that should terrify every CTO: 75% of enterprise workers say AI has helped them do tasks they literally couldn't do before. That's not a 10% productivity bump—that's people suddenly operating outside their skill envelopes, with mixed results. It's like giving everyone a motorcycle without bothering to mention that helmets exist.</p><p>OpenAI has watched this unfold across over a million businesses, and they've noticed something. The companies winning with AI aren't necessarily the ones with the best models (though that helps). They're the ones who figured out how to deploy agents without creating digital anarchy. A major manufacturer cut production optimization from six weeks to one day. An investment company freed up 90% of salespeople's time. An energy producer added a billion dollars in revenue through a 5% output increase. These aren't pilot projects—they're production systems doing real work.</p><p>But here's the gap OpenAI is trying to close: most enterprises are drowning in disconnected systems. They've got agents everywhere, each one isolated, each one with limited context, each one essentially guessing at what it should be doing. Every new agent adds complexity instead of reducing it. It's the software equivalent of hiring 500 interns and giving them all different versions of the employee handbook.</p><p>The Frontier platform, announced today, is OpenAI's attempt to fix this at the infrastructure level. It's not a model upgrade—it's an enterprise operating system for AI agents. The pitch is straightforward: give agents the same things people need to succeed at work. Shared context so they know what's happening across the business. Onboarding so they understand internal processes. Feedback loops so they improve over time. And—crucially—permissions and boundaries so they don't accidentally delete half your database while trying to optimize it.</p><p>This matters because the pace of AI development is frankly absurd. OpenAI ships something new roughly every three days. Keeping up while maintaining control is becoming a full-time job for entire teams. The companies that figure out how to balance experimentation with governance are pulling ahead fast, and everyone else is scrambling to catch up.</p><p>Frontier represents a bet that the next phase of enterprise AI isn't about bigger models or flashier demos. It's about the deeply unglamorous work of integration, governance, and making sure your AI coworkers don't need constant hand-holding. In other words, the future looks a lot more like competent middle management than science fiction.</p><p>Whether enterprises are ready to treat AI agents as actual coworkers—with proper onboarding, training, and oversight—remains to be seen. But after watching companies struggle to deploy even basic automation without creating chaos, it's clear that something like Frontier was inevitable. The only surprise is that it took this long.</p>"
